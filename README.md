In this assignment, I combined data regarding students and schools to draw some conclusions. 

I performed analysis on the standardized test results for a whole district. I did an overall analysis and found that the average math and english scores are both in the high C low B range. 

When I grouped my combined files by schools, I noticed that district schools had a much lower percentage of students that passed both math and english than the charter schools. The scores were also generally lower in the the district schools than in the charter schools. 

Overall, the students generally do better in english than in math. When catagorized by grade, the average scores for reading were consistantly in the low B range. With the math scores, it was mixed with C's and B's. 

In regards to budget, spending more money per student does not improve learning or teaching ability. In fact, the schools that are spending 585 dollars or less per student are doing slightly better in reading and significantly better in math.
